Many AGI-like code-generation models use architectures similar to the Transformer,
which was first popularized by the success of language models like GPT.
These models are trained on vast amounts of text data that includes source code from 
different programming languages. For example, during training, the model learns the
patterns of how functions are defined, loops are constructed, and variables are declared.
When generating code, it predicts the next token (which could be a keyword, variable
name, operator, etc.) based on the context of the previous tokens.
